Trying to learn functional programming in vanilla javascript

This simulates very basic combat between a boss and group of heroes.

The heroes hp and attack is randomized, somewhat based on their job (character class). The boss is also randomized and has a job of boss, giving that object much higher stats.

The program then runs through combat to decide who wins, logging combat events to the console displaying the result on screen.

I also played around with prototypes, using the Object.setPrototypeOf() for the heroes and bosses.
