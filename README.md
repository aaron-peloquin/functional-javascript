# Functional Javascript
## Functional A (Combat Simulator)
Learning functional programming in vanilla javascript. Running the main.js either with `node main.js` or by loading it through your browser simulates very basic combat between a boss and group of heroes.

* The heroes hp and attack is randomized, somewhat based on their job (character class). The boss is also randomized and has a job of boss, giving that object much higher stats.
* The program then runs through combat to decide who wins, logging combat events to the console displaying the result on screen.

I also played around with prototypes, using the Object.setPrototypeOf() for the heroes and bosses.

## Functional B (Character Data)
Second tiny project while learning functional javascript, I organized my code better in this project, and it's scope is smaller than Functional A was.

## Iterators
Learning / practicing various types of iterators with the for..of syntax.

## GraphQL
Attempting to write a GraphQL client to pull user data from github.

## Random Practice
Learning / practicing various random bits of javascript.

* Binary Opperators
* Fetch promises
* Getters / Setters
* Attempted to write an O(log(n)) function to seek out letters.
